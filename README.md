# Schrodinger_equation_for_particle_in_Gaussian_trap
We solve the Schrodinger equation for particle in Gaussian trap. Example, atoms trapped in tweezer trap.

schrodinger_2D.py contains all the functions to solve the 2D schrodinger equation. It can be used to find both the eigenfunctions and time-dependent evolutions. 
schrodinger_cylindrical_2D contains all the functions to solve the 3D schrodinger equation in Cylindrical space. This solves only the radial and the axial part. The angular part can be solved exactly.  

The Jupyter notebooks show examples for calculating eigenvalues and eigenfunctions.
